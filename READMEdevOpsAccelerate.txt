In my CI, I have the GitHub action for Autopep8 running and also the GitHub action to build and push the app as a Docker image to DockerHub.

The GitHub action for autopep8 is a tool that helps to automatically formats Python code to conform to the PEP 8 style guide. This action is designed to be used in conjunction with Create Pull Request. This will automatically create a pull request to merge fixes that autopep8 makes to python code in my repository.
